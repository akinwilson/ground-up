# From numpy arrays to tensorflow tensors: Computational graphs from the ground up

Machine learning is about finding implicit structure in data an exploiting it. This repository contains samples that motivate the need for _deep learning_; a subset of machine learning techniques. Deep learning makes use of non linearities within their architectures to over come the issues associated with target spaces that are not [linearly separable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_separability) (for the case of supervised learning)
